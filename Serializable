We need to provide the JVM with a unique identifier when converting a serialized stream of bytes back into an object with a serialVersionUID. Add a private static final long to the Car class named serialVersionUID with a value of 1L.

import java.io.Serializable;

public class Car implements Serializable {
private String make;
private int year;
/* We need to provide the JVM with a unique identifier when converting a serialized stream of bytes back into an object with a serialVersionUID. Add a private static final long to the Car class named serialVersionUID with a value of 1L.*/
private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

public Car (String make, int year){
   this.make = make;
   this.year = year;
}

}
